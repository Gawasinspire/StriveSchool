# Famous Hypothesis Testings

Although there are hundreds of statistical hypothesis tests that you could use, there is only a small subset that we need to use in a machine learning project.

Here, an attempt to make list of famous hypothesis testing which could serve as cheat sheet in future. 

Each statistical test is presented in a consistent way, including:
	. The name of the test.
	. What the test is checking.
	. The key assumptions of the test.
	. How the test result is interpreted.
	. Python API for using the test.
